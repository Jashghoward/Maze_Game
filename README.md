The Maze Game

The goal is to get the ball to the finishing block.

Use WASD to control the ball.

This is a web apllication that makes use of JS libraries to create the physics affect seen in the game.

The Gravity toggle is set to 1, if it gets set to 0 then there will be no gravity


Issues to fix: 

The ball going throught the wall.

When using the directional keys, if there are multiple taps on one key the ball can go through the walls of the maze.

Fucnctionality to add: 

- A gravity toggle that will turn the gravity on or off from the home screen. This will be a button that when pressed will turn the gravity  of the board on or off.

- A color change toggle, add in the ability to change the color of the board.
