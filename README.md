The Maze Game

The goal is to get the ball to the finishing block.

Use WASD to control the ball.

This is a web apllication that makes use of JS libraries to create the physics affect seen in the game.

The Gravity toggle is set to 1, if it gets set to 0 then there will be no gravity


Issues to fix: 

The ball going throught the wall.

When using the directional keys, if there are multiple taps on one key the ball can go through the walls of the maze.
